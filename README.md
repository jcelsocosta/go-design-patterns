# Design Pattern
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.[1]

There are a few groups of design patterns: creational, structural, and behavioral.

* Creational patterns provide mechanisms for creating objects that increase flexibility and code reuse.

* Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while still keeping the structure flexible and efficient.

* Behavioral patterns take care of efficient communication and assignment of responsibilities between objects.

# Design Pattern
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.[1]

There are a few groups of design patterns: creational, structural, and behavioral.

* __Creational__ patterns provide mechanisms for creating objects that increase flexibility and code reuse.

* __Structural__ patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while still keeping the structure flexible and efficient.

* __Behavioral__ patterns take care of efficient communication and assignment of responsibilities between objects.

## Princípios SOLID
__Single Responsibility Principle__ - Each class is responsible for a single piece of functionality provided by the software, and has that responsibility be entirely encapsulated by the class.[1]

__Open/Closed Principle__ - Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification[1]

__Liskov Substitution Principle__ - A subclass must remain compatible with the behavior of the superclass[1].

__Interface Segragation Principle__ - Customers should not be forced to rely on methods they do not use.[1]

__Dependency Inversion Principle__ - High-level classes should not depend on low-level classes. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.[1]

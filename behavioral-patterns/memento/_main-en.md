# Memento pattern explained

## Memento
Memento is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.[1]

## When to use it
* When you want to produce snapshots of an object's state to be able to restore a previous state of the object.
* When you want direct access to an object's fields/getters/setters that violates its encapsulation.

# Command pattern explained

## Command
Command is a behavioral design pattern that transforms a request into an independent object that contains all the information about the request. This transformation allows you to parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue the execution of the request, and support operations that cannot be performed.[1]

## When to use it
* When you want to parameterize objects with operations.
* When you want to queue operations, schedule their execution, or repeat them externally.
* When you want to implement reversible operations.

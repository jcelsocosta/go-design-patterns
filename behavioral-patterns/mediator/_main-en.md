# Abstract Factory pattern explained

## Abstract Factory
The Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. The pattern restricts direct communications between objects and forces collaboration only through the mediator object.[1]

## When to use it
* When you want to provide loose coupling between two objects that must communicate between them
* when you want to reduce the amount of dependencies of a particular type to the minimum by passing these needs to the mediator pattern

# Strategy pattern explained

## Strategy
Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, place them in separate classes, and make their objects interchangeable.[1]

## When to use it
* When you want to use different variants of an algorithm within an object, you are able to switch from one algorithm to another at runtime.
* All types achieve the same functionality in a different way but the client of the strategy isn't affected

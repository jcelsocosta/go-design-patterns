# Observer pattern explained

## Observer
The Observer is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they are observing..[1]

## When to use it
* When you want changes in the state of one object to change other objects, and the current set of objects is unknown in advance or changes dynamically.
* When you want some objects in your application to observe others, but only for a limited time or in specific cases.

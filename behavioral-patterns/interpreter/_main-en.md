# Interpreter pattern explained

## Interpreter
The Interpreter is a behavioral pattern that provides a way to interpret specific languages ​​by defining a grammar and a mechanism for evaluating expressions in that language. It uses a hierarchy of classes to represent each rule of the grammar and allows sentences or commands to be interpreted in a specific context.

## When to use it
* When you have a well-defined and stable grammar.
* When you have repetitive rules.
* When you want to have a personalized interpretation.

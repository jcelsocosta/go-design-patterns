# Template method pattern explained

## Template Method
The Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without modifying its structure.[1]

## When to use it
* When you want to let clients extend only particular steps of an algorithm, but not the entire algorithm and its structure.
* When you want multiple classes that contain nearly identical algorithms with some minor differences.

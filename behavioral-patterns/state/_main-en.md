# State pattern explained

## State
State is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object has changed class.[1]

## When to use it
* When you want an object to behave differently depending on its current state, when the number of states is huge, and when the specific state code changes frequently.
* When you want a class populated with giant conditionals that change how the class behaves based on the current values ​​of the class's fields.
* When you have a lot of duplicate code across many similar states and transitions in a condition-based state machine.

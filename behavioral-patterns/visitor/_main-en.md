# Visitor pattern explained

## Visitor
The Observer is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they are observing.[1]

## When to use it
* When you want to perform an operation on all elements of a complex object structure (e.g., an object tree).
* When you want to clean up business logic from auxiliary behaviors.
* When you want a behavior to make sense only within some classes of a class hierarchy, but not in others.

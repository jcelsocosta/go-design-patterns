# Bridge pattern explained

## Bridge
Bridge is a structural design pattern that allows you to divide a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—that can be developed independently of each other.[1]

## When to use it
* When you want to divide and organize a monolithic class that has several variants of the same functionality (for example, if the class can work with several database servers).
* When you want to extend a class in several orthogonal (independent) dimensions.
* When you want to be able to swap implementations at runtime.

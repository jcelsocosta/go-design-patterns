# Adapter pattern explained

## Adapter
Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate with each other.[1]

## When to use it
* When you want to use an existing class, but its interface is not compatible with the rest of your code
* When you want to reuse several existing subclasses that do not have some common functionality that cannot be added to the superclass.

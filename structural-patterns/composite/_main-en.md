# Composite pattern explained

## Composite
Composite is a structural design pattern that allows you to place objects into tree structures and then work with those structures as if they were individual objects.[1]

## When to use it
* When you want to implement a tree-like object structure.
* When you want client code to treat both simple and compound objects uniformly.

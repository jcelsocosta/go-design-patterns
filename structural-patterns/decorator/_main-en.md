# Decorator pattern explained

## Decorator
The Decorator is a structural design pattern that allows you to attach new behaviors to objects by placing them inside object wrappers that contain the behaviors.[1]

## When to use it
* When you want to be able to design additional behaviors for objects at runtime without breaking the code that uses those objects.
* When it is difficult or impossible to extend an object's behavior using inheritance.

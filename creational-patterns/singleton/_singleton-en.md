# Singleton pattern explained

## Singleton
It is a creational design pattern that allows you to ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to that instance.[1]

## When to use it

* When you want to use the same connection to a database
* When you need to limit access to some variable or space, you use a singleton as a port for that variable

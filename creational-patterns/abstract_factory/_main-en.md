# Abstract Factory pattern explained

## Abstract Factory
Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that allows you to produce families of related objects without having to specify their concrete classes..[1]

## When to use it
* When you want to provide a new layer of encapsulation for factory methods that return a common interface for all factories
* When you want to group common factories into a super factory

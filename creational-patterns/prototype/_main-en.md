# Prototype pattern explained

## Prototype
Prototype is a creational design pattern that allows you to copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.[1]

## When to use it
* maintain a set to objects that will be cloned to create new instances
* provide a default value of some type to start working on top of it
* free cpu of complex object initialization to take more memory resources

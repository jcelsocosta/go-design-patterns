# Factory pattern explained

## Factory
The Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to change the type of objects that are created.[1]

Objects returned by a factory method are often called products.[1]

## When to use it
* When you want to delegate the creation of new instances of structures to a different part of the program
* When you want to work at the interface level rather than concrete implementations

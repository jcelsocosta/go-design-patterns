# Builder pattern explained

## Builder
The Builder, also known as constructor, is a creational design pattern that allows you to construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.[1]

The director defines the order in which to execute the construction steps[2]. The director is not mandatory; in some cases, it may not be convenient to implement it.

## When to use it
* When you want to avoid long constructors
* When you want create an object step by step by filling its field
